What is Heuristics?

A heuristic is a "good guess" function used as a building block of a larger algorithm, often in search or optimization problems. It's a problem-dependent technique that exploits specific information about the problem to find a "good enough" solution. Heuristics are usually designed to solve a specific problem or a narrow class of problems.

What is Metaheuristics?

A metaheuristic is a high-level, problem-independent algorithmic framework that provides guidelines or strategies to develop heuristic optimization algorithms. It's a "good guess" system that keeps refining its guesses. Metaheuristics are designed to be applicable to a broad range of problems, treating functions as black boxes. They often implement stochastic optimization, which means the solution found is dependent on the set of random variables generated.

What is GA?

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It's a population-based optimization algorithm that uses the principles of evolution to evolve a population of solutions over generations. GA is a global search algorithm that can find optimal or near-optimal solutions to optimization and search problems.

What is SA?

Simulated Annealing (SA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It's a probabilistic optimization algorithm that mimics the physical process of heating and cooling a material to find the minimum energy state. SA is a local search algorithm that can find optimal or near-optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.

Difference between GA and SA?

- Search strategy: SA uses a temperature schedule to control the exploration of the search space, while GA uses a population of solutions and selection, crossover, and mutation operators to search for better solutions.
- Convergence: SA is known for its ability to converge to a good solution quickly, while GA can take longer to converge, but often finds better solutions.
- Parameter tuning: SA requires tuning of the temperature schedule, while GA requires tuning of population size, selection pressure, crossover rate, and mutation rate.
- Computational complexity: SA can be computationally expensive, especially for large problem instances, while GA can be more efficient in terms of computational resources.
